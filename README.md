# unsupervised


Welcome to unsupervised! This Python library provides implementations of 
dimensionality reduction techniques including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD),
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor 
Embedding (t-SNE). These techniques are useful for reducing the dimensionality 
of data while preserving important information.

## Installation

You can install unsupervised using pip:

```bash
pip install -e
